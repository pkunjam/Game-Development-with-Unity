# Game Development with unity

These are the games that I have developed when I was learning Game Development from the online resources.

## Work

Stones is a beginners game programming assigment to learn how to instantiate objects in a scene and make them move.

**Short Way Home**

This game programming assignment was meant to use the data structure and algorithms in the game. I have used the application of "Dijkstra's Algorithm" to guide the person to reach the destination through the shortest path.
